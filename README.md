This is a working branch of PgBench from PostgreSQL 9.3beta that's been
modified to support multi-master connections.

It isn't quite ready to upstream yet, but when it's merged this repo will
likely go away.

DO NOT FORK THIS REPO or submit patches based on it. Instead use the multibench
branch of https://github.com/ringerc/postgres .
